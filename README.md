## Entry One
Create a website under GitHub pages and post the "blog" there.
You don’t have to create a map for this assignment.
Based on the topic for your final project, explore previous mapping projects (using the same data that you’re interested in using would be fantastic, but it's not mandatory). 
Following this analysis, think what type of intervention you would like to do, what would you add, and how you would do it. Try to be explicit in the steps you will take to analyze this data: what data are you using, what type of analysis are you thinking about doing for your final project, what limitations do you find by using this data, what population are you’re interested in "intervening", who you are excluding in your analysis, and how it differs from previous efforts that have worked around the same topic. This part will help you have a plan for your final projects.
Previous Mapping projects: 
Queer Maps: “A rich map of published addresses of active LGBTQ bars, nightclubs, organizations, etc. from 1871 to today.”
Population: Queer Maps is a mapping project not just for the LGBTQIA+ community, but also is open to anyone regardless of sexuality. The most interesting thing about these sort of community-centric projects is that it often opens up the community to others - which expands the audience and requires a sort of intentionality behind the work being done. 
Method of Intervention: Queer Maps is trying to visibilize the extensive history of queer spaces that contributed to the commercial and cultural growth of the city. In mapping locations of significance to the community, Queer Maps keeps the presence of the LGBTQIA+ alive even if these places have been forgotten or ignored in time. 
Assumptions: Queer Maps pulls data from archived information under the assumption that these archives are accurate and all the locations are complete. Each listing are also made under the assumption that these listings are unbiased, non-anecdotal, and are free from socioeconomic factors that may have affected the inclusion or exclusion of information. 
Inclusions: Not only does Queer Maps include past significant LGBTQIA+ spaces, the project also has attempted to include current examples. 
Exclusions: Queer Maps, while thorough, has a statistically significant lack of non-gay, white male spaces in comparison to QPOC, lesbian, bisexual, and trans-designated spaces. In addition, Queer Maps is not an all-encompassing project. The areas mapped appear to be grouped together, leaving a large swath of the city under-mapped and unmarked. 
Social Justice: Queer Maps is based on the idea that these often underserved or ignored (by the mainstream) spaces in Los Angeles are significant and relevant - and that everyone should be able to access the rich history of the queer community in Los Angeles. By compiling research and archive data, Queer Maps makes historical and current information available to those who would either not have the access or resources to be able to pore over the information themselves. 
Is it trying to maximize the wellbeing of the largest number of the population, or does it only focus on a disadvantaged community?: Queer Maps is mainly focused on empowering a disadvantaged community. Due to the focus on specifically queer spaces, there is an implied exclusion of outsiders to the communities - not necessarily to the access of this information, but definitely to the recognition of outsiders.
Success: Queer Maps is successful in what it sought to do. The map is highly legible and stock-filled with information, as well as acting as an important tool for the queer community in Los Angeles.
